## DB Scheme
![DB-Scheme](https://i.gyazo.com/86ef26ffb118c2f5bb476ef7b07411f8.png)
As tables that dont depend of others we've got service, that is just a table with the id, name of service an a description of the service we offer and role that show the id of the role and the name of that role.
Next we have the table users which is related to role and appointment. The relation consist in every user has a role, which currently can be super_admin, artist or user (the default one). <br/>
Appointment table has two foreign key, both are from user_id, in client_id column we have users with role user or roleId 3 and in artist_id column just can be there user whose role are 1 or 2 (I'm assuming the owner of the shop or super_admin is also an artist).

## Local installation
1. Clone the repository ``` git clone https://github.com/FornesBorja/tatooStudioBackend.git```
2. Open the folder
3. ` $ npm i `
4. Copy the .env.example file, change the name of the copy to .env.
5. Write the .env file with your server parameters, to make the server work.
6. ``` $ npm run migrate ``` 
7. ``` $ npm run seed ``` 
8. ``` $ npm run dev ```
